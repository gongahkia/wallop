## Credit

Concept-wise, `Wallop` takes much inspiration from [Rumblr](https://rumblr.webflow.io/). However, the idea for a *'tinder but for fighting'* app only really came to my attention after a conversation with [Jace Bong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jace-bong-%F0%9F%91%BE-42b3841b1/?originalSubdomain=sg) in [IS111](https://www.reddit.com/r/SMU_Singapore/comments/14bouko/smu_is_tough_modules_and_is111/?rdt=39799) in my first semester of [university](https://www.smu.edu.sg/).

I've slept on the idea until now, but hopefully I have done it justice.

### 1. Purpose of the Application

If it was not immediately apparent, this application is an act of [satirical](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/satirical) [social commentary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/social-commentary), meant to expose the absurdity of modern dating apps by transposing their mechanics onto the intentionally preposterous premise of consensual fighting.  
  
Please be aware that while [`Wallop`](https://github.com/gongahkia/wallop) is a functional web application, it is **not** intended for any actual use, **nor** does it endorse or facilitate any actual fighting. [`Wallop`](https://github.com/gongahkia/wallop) is meant as a purely theoretical platform and all content in this README.md and any source code is protected under artistic speech.

### 2. Resemblance

Any substantive similarity or resemblance to existing digital services, social platforms, or human behavioral patterns is purely coincidental and constitutes part of [`Wallop`](https://github.com/gongahkia/wallop)'s satirical methodology. [`Wallop`](https://github.com/gongahkia/wallop) therefore expressly disclaims any intentional reference to or imitation of any existing digital services, social platforms, or human behavioral patterns.
